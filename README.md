# Notes on this fork:

* I wish to impliment a bunch more protocols to fall in line with the the [Composable Network Protocols](https://250bpm.com/blog:121/index.html) blog post
* I have alternate compile scripts out of tree
* This is a work in progress
* I wish to make it easier (IE the header is public) to impliment new protocols out of the source tree
* DNS queries should be a public interface (possibility have the option to have more than one configuration)
* I wish to make the code easier to read (IE: there are comments)
* I work on this fork [on stream](https://twitch.tv/fossunleashed)
